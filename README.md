# Lumina
 Lumina is a skincare store website made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
It has a homepage that introduces the brand, a shop page that lists products, a working cart to add and view items, and a reviews section where customers can leave feedback.
When someone visits the site, they should be able to see the products, add them to the cart, check their cart items, and read or post reviews that stay saved even if the page is refreshed.
